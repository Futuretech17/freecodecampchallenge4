                    <h2>Why Should I learn Python?</h2>
                </header>
                <div>
                    <p>The primary reason associated with the popularity of Python is, 
                        it is a great and easy way to learn to code. It has a feature of 
                        quickly writing complicated tasks. Many significant applications 
                        only support Python language. The popularity of the Python language 
                        in 2020 will be very high.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other than that there are many other reasons to learn python.
                        Here are some.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python is versatile.</li>
                        <li>Python is the fastest growing programming language.</li>
                        <li>python is easy to learn,read and write.</li>
                    </ul>

                <header>
                    <h2>Get Started</h2>
                </header>
                <div>
                    <p>To get started with Python you need to download <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a>
                        from the official website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that you need to install python in your computer. You are partially
                        there since you can already run python through console or cmd.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This can be done by typing <i>python</i> into the the cmd. This is
                        an easy way but not the best. For you to completely experience the
                        full potential of python you need to download a python <strong>IDE</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are many IDE's that support python such as:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>pycharm</li>
                        <li>Thonny</li>
                        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>My first program</h3>
                    <p>print("Hello")</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="conclusion">
                <header>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                </header>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Programming is one of the most marketable courses and very useful since we are surrounded 
                        by the Tech environment and it grows day by day.
                        If your passion is designing softwares, python is the best way to go. Thank me later.

                    <p>
                        The best way to get started is to use python.org website here you will have all the basics
